# SwiftNeuro

This project aims to implement neural networks from the ground up using Swift and Apple's core libraries. We'll focus on understanding the fundamental concepts and algorithms behind neural networks while adhering to best practices for Swift development.

## Goals

*   Implement core neural network components (layers, activation functions, etc.) in Swift.
*   Build a solid foundation for understanding neural network architectures and training processes.
*   Adhere to Apple's engineering best practices for code style, performance, and maintainability.
*   Utilize the Gitflow workflow for efficient collaboration and code management.
